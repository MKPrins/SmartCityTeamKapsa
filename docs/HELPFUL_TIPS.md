### 'Remote - SSH' plugin for VSCode
This plugin allows you to directly connect over ssh and make changes to the files on the local filesystem of the connected device. In our case this is the filesystem of the raspberry pi.

The plugin can be easily found by searching for it in the plugins tab inside VSCode.
