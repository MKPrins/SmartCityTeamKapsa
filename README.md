# SmartCityTeamKapsa
This is a small college project for the module Smart City. The code is this project is for a device that is designed to spray a (cooling) mist whenever the current temperature or humidity exceed a certain threshhold. This device is intended to be installed at bus stops.

### Project structure
The [src](./src) folder contains the full code that is used for the complete product.

The folder [SingularModuleTestScripts](./SingularModuleTestScripts/) contains a sub folder for each individual hardware module / component that is used in the development of the misting device. Each containing a relatively short test script and documentation on how the hardware module in question works, the prerequisites and some troubleshooting of pitfalls that we have come across.

### Further documentation
Please check out further documentation within the [docs](./docs) folder for info on get started, how to contribute and some helpful tips.
